            If your house is clean, well-built, has a fresh water supply, and is located in a secure, sought-after neighbourhood... but still you do not receive the right amount of rent it deserves, We suggest converting it into a PG and adding some basic furnishings and amenities to increase the rent for the same space.
          </p>

          <p className="service-description">
            We pair you with the right PG tenants, handle thorough background checks, manage every vacancy, and fill rooms in record timeâ€”so you get the rent you're owed without lifting a finger. This is an end-to-end PG management service we offer.
